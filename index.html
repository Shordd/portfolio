            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there, I'm Kris, a programmer with a passion for Pen Testing and programing.<br>

                I'm a firm believer in the power of teamwork, and I strive to bring that philosophy to every project I work on. Whether I'm working on a small project or a large one, I always give it my all and make sure it's the best it can be. <br>
                
                When I'm not working, I enjoy sports like going to the gym and martial arts. I find that these hobbies help me stay creative and inspired, and I often find myself drawing inspiration from them in my work.<br>
                 
                If you're interested in working together, I'd love to hear from you. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
